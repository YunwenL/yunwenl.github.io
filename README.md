I am a researcher in cryptography. I work as a senior researcher in a blockchain startup [Cryptape](https://twitter.com/cryptape?lang=en). I was an associate research fellow and a lecturer in mathematics from 2019 to 2021. I received my Ph.D in cryptography under the supervision of [Prof. dr. ir. Vincent Rijmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Rijmen), from COSIC KU Leuven, Belgium in 2018. My Ph.D thesis is [Techniques for Block Cipher Cryptanalysis](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/publications/thesis-306.pdf). 

## Research Interests

### Symmetric-key cryptography
My main focus is on the security evaluation of lightweight ciphers with rotational cryptanalysis, linear cryptanalysis, etc, as well as using mathematics to improve our understanding of distinguishers.
- Mathematical theory of cryptanalysis
- New methods to build distinguishers
- Automated cryptanalysis with constraint programming (SAT/SMT/MILP)

### Blockchain payment channel networks
I worked on the protocol design of a payment channel network in a real-world blockchain ecosystem.
- Payment channels with improved features, e.g., constant collateral, value privacy, rebalancing
- Applications of cryptographic primitives in blockchain technology
