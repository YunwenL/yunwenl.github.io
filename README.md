## About 
I am a researcher in cryptography. I work as a senior researcher in a blockchain startup Cryptape. I was an associate research fellow and a lecturer in mathematics in National university of defense technology, China, from 2019 to 2021. I received my Ph.D in cryptography under the supervising of Prof. dr. ir. Vincent Rijmen, from COSIC KU Leuven, Belgium in 2018. My Ph.D thesis is [Techniques for Block Cipher Cryptanalysis](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/publications/thesis-306.pdf). 

## Research Interests

### Symmetric-key cryptography
My main focus is on the security evaluations of lightweight ciphers with rotational cryptanalysis, linear cryptanalysis, etc, as well as a better understanding of the distinguishers in a mathematical view
- Mathematical theory of cryptanalysis techniques
- New methods to build distinguishers
- Automated cryptanalysis with constraint programming (SAT/SMT/MILP)

### Blockchain payment channel networks
I worked on the protocol design of a payment channel network in a real-world blockchain ecosystem
- Payment channels with improved features, e.g., constant collateral, value privacy, rebalancing
- Applications of cryptographic primitives in blockchain technology
